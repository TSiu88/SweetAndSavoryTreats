## Description

This application is the Week 12 Friday independent assignment for Epicodus' full time Intro to Programming and C#/React course.  This is an application made to show use of a many-to-many database and use of authentication with Identity.

This application was created to market a baker's sweet and savory treats.  Only users that can log in are able to create, update, and delete the different items in the database but anyone could view them without logging in.  The application shows different treats and different flavors and is flexible in allowing items of one type to be connected to many of the other type (like having a Cinnamon treat be in the flavors Sweet and Spicy or the flavor Sweet having cookies and cake connected to them).  Interlinked details pages for both flavors and treats makes it easy to find other related items.
