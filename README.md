## Description

_README under construction_
<!-- _Detailed desc w/ purpose/usage, what does, motivation to create, why exists, other info for users/developers to have_ -->

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_This program requires .NET Core SDK to run. [Here is a free tutorial](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-c-and-net) for installing .NET on Mac or Windows 10 from the [official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/)._ 

_This program also makes use of SQL databases. We recommend using MySQL Workbench to build your databases. [Here is a free tutorial](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql) for installing MySQL WorkBench and MySQL Community Server on Mac (using links [Mac1](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) and [Mac2](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)) or [Windows 10](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919)._

### Requirements to Run

* _.NET Core_
* _ASP.NET Core MVC_
* _MySQL Workbench_
* _MySQL Community Server_
* _Entity Framework_
* _Command Prompt_
* _Web Browser_ 

### Instructions

*This application may be viewed by:*

1. Download and install .NET Core from the [official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/)
2. Download and install MySQL Workbench and Community Server for Mac or Windows by following the instructions [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).
3. Click clone the [repository](https://github.com/TSiu88/SweetAndSavoryTreats.git) from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/TSiu88) to copy the repository link
4. Use a command line interface to type `git clone (repository-link-here)` to copy the project into the current folder and then move into the repository's directory that was just created with `cd (project-name-here)`
5. Start up a local server by opening MySQL Workbench and adding a `MySQL Connections` using the default IP address and Port (IP 127.0.0.1, Port 3306), username (root), and password from setup.
6. Construct the database by entering in the following lines under the `Query 1` section and then clicking execute:
  >
    CREATE DATABASE tiffany_siu;
    USE tiffany_siu;
    CREATE TABLE stylists (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));
    CREATE TABLE clients (id serial PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(255));
7. Run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` in command line interface of the repository's main project directory
8. Run `dotnet run` to start up the program in the command line interface
9. Type the URL listed under "Now listening on:" into a web browser to run
